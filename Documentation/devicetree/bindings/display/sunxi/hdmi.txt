Allwinner HDMI Transmitter
==========================

The Allwinner HDMI transmitters are included in the SoCs.
They support audio and video.

Required properties:
 - compatible : should be one of
		"allwinner,sun8i-a83t-hdmi"
		"allwinner,sun8i-h3-hdmi"
 - reg: base address and size of the I/O memory
 - clocks : phandles to the HDMI clocks as described in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
 - clock-names : must be
		"bus" : bus gate
		"clock" : streaming clock
		"ddc-clock" : DDC clock
 - resets : One or two phandles to the HDMI resets
 - reset-names : when 2 phandles, must be
		"hdmi0" and "hdmi1"
 - #address-cells : should be <1>
 - #size-cells : should be <0>

Required nodes:
 - port: Audio and video input port nodes with endpoint definitions
	as defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
	port@0 is video and port@1 is audio.

Example:

	hdmi: hdmi@01ee0000 {
		compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-a83t-hdmi";
		reg = <0x01ee0000 0x20000>;
		clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_HDMI>, <&ccu CLK_HDMI>,
			 <&ccu CLK_HDMI_DDC>;
		clock-names = "bus", "clock", "ddc-clock";
		resets = <&ccu RST_HDMI0>, <&ccu RST_HDMI1>;
		reset-names = "hdmi0", "hdmi1";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&hdmi_pins_a>;
		status = "disabled";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		port@0 {			/* video */
			reg = <0>;
			hdmi_tcon1: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&tcon1_hdmi>;
			};
		};
		port@1 {			/* audio */
			reg = <1>;
			hdmi_i2s2: endpoint {
				remote-endpoint = <&i2s2_hdmi>;
			};
		};
	};
